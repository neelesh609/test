							<h1>Titanic Data Analysis</h1>
							<p class="major"> <a href=""></a>This is a competition where we use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.<a href=""></a>.</p>
							<p>Kaggle is a wonderful platform which has helped learn machine learning models. I have implemented a few of these models in the current project where I have tried to analyse the titanic dataset and find out the number of survivors based on the various attributes given in the dataset.
								This report contains the steps and approaches I have involved in trying to find the number of survivors from the test data set

							<h2>Survival according to Age</h2>
							<p>Here i have taken age as a factor to find out what age categories survival rate is the highest.
							 According to the data inage we can draw the conclusion that , people of age median 30 has the highest survival rate.
							At the same time we can draw the conclusion that the people of age median 25 has the lowest survival rate.</p>

								<h3>Visualisation of Passengers class in Test Data</h3>
								<p>We can draw a few importatnt conclusions from this graph :
									 we see that maximum passengers are travellers in the third class
									we see that about 30%of the travellers are from first class 
						            also about 15% are from second class where as more than 55% of passengers belong to third class </p>

						<h2>Visualising Age based on Class</h2>
						<p>we can note that the third class is the most filled the median age of people on the ship is approximately 30 ie most of the people on board are approximately 30.</p>
						<ul class="actions stacked">
							<img width='300px' height='300px' src="images/age vis train.png" alt="" /> <br/><br/><br/>
							<p> We can notice that even in the test data given , the third class is the most filled with people of age 25-30 and the first class contains the range of 40-60 more.
								People of age 60-80 are the least in 3rd class.

						<h2>Survivors by Class</h2>
						<p>comparison in 1st class :
							The deceased here is lesser than the number of passengers who have survived
						   Comparison in 2nd class :
						    The deceased here are almost equal to the number of people who have survived , just a tad bit more deceased compared to the survivors.
						Comparison in the 3rd class :
						     The number of passengers deceased here are way more than the number of survivors.

							<h4>My approach involved classifying the data and finding the survivors.
								I tried to find out important attributes which affected the survival, like age, class and Relatives
								Relatives includes: Parch and SibSp.<br/><br/>
								I tried to find the survivors based on age and found out the most survivors are of the age :20-30.<br/><br/>
								I tried to find the survivors based on class and found out the most survivors were from the first class.<br/><br/>
								I tried to incorporate Relatives to see how many members of the same family survived but was not successful, however my I shall try and learn more models of ML so that I will be able to implement them and find a better meaning from the data and classify the survivors in a more efficient way.
